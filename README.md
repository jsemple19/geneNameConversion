##Converting C elegans gene names between different genome versions

I used to use bioMart (convertingGeneNames.R and convertingGeneNamesFunction.R) but then they changed all the field codes again... and after going through the trouble of finding how they changes it looks like there is no sequence name as there used to be, so i am now trying a different approach downloading the gene names from WormMine.
